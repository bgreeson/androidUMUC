String uploadUrl = blobstoreService.createUploadUrl("/upload", UploadOptions.Builder.withGoogleStorageBucketName("my_bucket"));

<form action="<%= blobstoreService.createUploadUrl("/upload") %>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="myFile">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

I uploaded a new version of the PHP that should now properly handle the file upload:

It uses a variable for 'action' to define what function you want within the request method.
The URL format to POST is: http://androidsoundappproject.appspot.com/server?action=upload_file

In PHP I have to gernerate the upload url with the following:
$upload_url = CloudStorageTools::createUploadUrl('/server?action=upload_file', $options)


From what I have found you would create the upload url in JAVA like this:
 
<form action="<%= blobstoreService.createUploadUrl("/server?action=message_create") %>" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <input type="file" name="userfile">
    <input type="submit" value="Submit">
</form>

Right now this is set up to upload the userfile to the /message folder in cloud storage.
